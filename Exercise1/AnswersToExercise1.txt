Look at the code; do you think that MyClass::operator=() is doing a deep or shallow copy?

    I believe that the overloaded = operator is doing a deep copy. In the function, the operator calls the
    copy function which allocates new memory for all the data members and copys the datamembers from the
    original object. We can check this by printing the address of copied objects.

Do you notice any warning posted by the compiler? Is there a memory leak issue? How can you fix it?

    Yes, when I run valgrind ./a.out I see that we lose 4 bytes of memory from running the program. I believe
    this is because we did not delete

Is MyClass::setIp() implemented correctly? What exactly does it do?

    Yes, I believe it is implemented correctly. When the function is called it correctly sets ip to a new ip.
